<h1>EasyGAN - Version 0 </h1>
An open source library that empowers machine learning practitioners to train and develop generative adversarial network (GAN) models on custom datasets: EasyGAN. With EasyGAN, you can experiment with various GAN architectures, tweak hyperparameters, and fine-tune models until you achieve the desired results.<br><br>

EasyGAN is built on top of TensorFlow, an open source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. This means that EasyGAN benefits from TensorFlow's robustness, scalability, and performance, while offering a high-level interface that makes it easy to use for both experts and beginners.

EasyGAN supports various GAN architectures such as vanilla GAN, Deep convolutional GAN, conditional GAN, and CycleGAN. It also provides pre-trained models and examples that can be used as a starting point for building your own custom models. Additionally, EasyGAN supports various evaluation metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score, making it easy to quantify the performance of your models.

Whether you're a researcher, a hobbyist, or a professional, EasyGAN provides a powerful platform for training and developing GAN models on your custom dataset. It is designed to make the process of training and developing GAN models easier and more convenient, even for beginners who are new to machine learning.
